# Analysis-of-Road-Traffic-Accidents
The focus of this project was to find the pattern in road traffic accident. The data has been collected from healthdata.gov. After collecting the data we  preprocess the data. Preprocessing is important as we need to handle all the missing values and outliers, remove unwanted attributes by feature subset selection, perform aggregation and remove continuous values using discretization so that the data is can be easily used for analysis. After improving the quality of the data with preprocessing techniques , we built various models and have discussed the performance of various models with our data set.The performance of the model is evaluated using some statistical analysis and best model is chosen.
